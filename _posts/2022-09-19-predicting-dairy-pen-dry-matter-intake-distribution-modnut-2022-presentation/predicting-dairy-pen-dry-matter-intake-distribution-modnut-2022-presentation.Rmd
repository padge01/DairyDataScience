This is the slideset I presented of my PhD work on a model building process to predict the distribution shape and parameters of dry matter intake for dairy cow pens. 

I gave this presentation at the [MODNUT](https://www.modnut2022.com) (Modelling Nutrient Digestion and Utilization in Farm Animals) conference in Alghero, Sardinia on the 19th of September 2022.

This work focused on the model building process of a machine learning neural network that will predict a distribution type and its parameters after training it to a database of simulated cow pens and group level statistics of each pen.
